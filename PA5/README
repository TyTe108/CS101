List.h: The header file of List ADT. listObj is defined in header as well

List.c: Where all the functions from List.h are defined. If you notice, I use "head" and "tail" instead of "front" and "back." 
  I would like to apologize for the usage but I am more used to it being called that way.
  
Graph.h The header file for Graph ADT, it works with both directed and undirected

Graph.c The source file for Graph ADT. I followed the textbook's pseudocode for DFS and Visit. 

GraphTest.c It's almost a copy and paste of professor's grading script and I passed everything 

PA5 is pretty much an extension of PA4.
