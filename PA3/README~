List.h: The header file of List ADT. listObj is defined in header as well

List.c: Where all the functions from List.h are defined. If you notice, I use "head" and "tail" instead of "front" and "back." 
  I would like to apologize for the usage but I am more used to it being called that way.
  
ListTest.c provided on webpage: I used this to initially test on my List. And the result came out the same as the expected result.

BigInteger.h Header file for BigInteger ADT

BigInteger.c Source file for BigInteger ADT

BigIntegerTest.c: I copied and changed the grading script so the test is thorough, anything that doesn't pass will show a fail

Arithmetic.c: It's the client module. All the FileIO operations are done correctly.
