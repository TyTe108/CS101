README:

List.h: The header file of List ADT. listObj is defined in header as well

List.c: Where all the functions from List.h are defined. If you notice, I use "head" and "tail" instead of "front" and "back." 
  I would like to apologize for the usage but I am more used to it being called that way.
  
ListTest.c provided on webpage: I used this to initially test on my List. And the result came out the same as the expected result.

Matrix.h: Header file for Matrix ADT. 

Matrix.c: Source file for Matrix ADT

MatrixTest.c

Makefile: Provided and edited

README: this file

Message to professor or TA: This PA wasn't too hard but it was extremely tedious. I did everything except Sparse. I burned out by 3 am. Please forgive me. I passed everything else according to the grading script though (Matrix and List tests). I'll make sure to start even earlier next time.
